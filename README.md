### About
  
This is a repo with some tools for parsing out data from Gettr, currently i'm using the `gogettr` lib to pull the data, though if this depreciates it's easy enough to replicate with requests (that's what they do, as the site has public endpoints.)  


### What is Gettr
  
From what I can see its like a cancel free Twitter that is gaining in hype, hence this repo. 

**Wikipedia** Definition (take from it what you will...)

```
Gettr (stylized GETTR) is a social media platform and microblogging site founded by Jason Miller, a former Donald Trump aide. Miller said Getter is "for everyone across the political spectrum" to come together and have debates as per the First Amendment. He also stated it was designed to be "cancel-free."[5]. It was officially launched on July 4, 2021. Its user interface and feature set have been described as very similar to those of Twitter.
